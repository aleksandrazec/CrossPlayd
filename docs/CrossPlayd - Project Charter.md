## Project description
The purpose of the application *CrossPlayd* is to allow users to track and review video games they've played all in one place. Rather than being a replacement for other video game scoring sites, like *MetaCritic* or *Steam Community Page*, this application focuses on creating a user-based community for every game of interest, no matter if the user owns it and independently of the platform they've played it on. This also allows for logging of older or discontinued games, as well as games that are not available on major platforms.
### Core functionalities
- Users can view a homepage which contains multiple tabs that display different video game categories, like trending, best rated, etc.
- Users can log video games they've played in their library and are able to rate them from 1 to 10. 
- They can categorize the games by marking them with *100 Percented*, *Completed*, *Playing*, *Paused*, *Dropped* and *Plan To Play*.
- Users can inform themselves on video games they're interested in by reading the game description, reading the reviews made by other users and the global rating of the game. 
- Users can interact with other users' reviews by replying to them.
## Budget estimate
This is an independent project developed by a small passionate group of developers, and therefore does not necessitate a budget. Note that the budget for the project will not be finalized until the project planning has been completed.
## Delivery deadline
The application with its core functionalities is expected to be delivered by end of June 2026. The project will be divided into key deliverables that will be incrementally implemented starting from February of 2026. Any additional functionalities will be subsequently planned and implemented.
## Approval
This project charter formally authorizes this project based on the information outlined above. Should any of the information change throughout the duration of the project, it shall be discussed between the project management team and documented appropriately.
